#  Symposium at UC Davis: At the Nexus of Mathematics, Scientific Computing, Biology, and Fluids

A symposium in honor of Angela Cheer, Professor of Mathematics, will be held in Davis on October 26th (1-5:45pm) in the Mathematical Science Building room 1147. 

## Schedule

* 1:00 Gerry Puckett, UC Davis: Welcome and introductions
* 1:15 Melissa Rodd, University College, London: Mathematics, Art, and Education
* 1:45 Daniel Goldston, San Jose State University: Prime Numbers: It Has Been a Good Millennium So Far
* 2:15 Anita Mayo, City University of New York: On the Accuracy of Particle Mesh Methods
* 2:45 Alexandre Chorin, UC Berkeley: Reduced order modeling, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, data-based discrete models, and the renormalization group
		Abstract: In many applications, the major roadblock to successful computing is the complexity of the numerical models. I will describe the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, which in principle produces a complexity reduction methodology without making any approximations, but is impractical without approximations. I will compare it with data-based modeling via discrete models based on parametric representations of time series. This comparison will bring in the renormalization group and suggest further methods for reducing complexity, and also for dealing with the biggest obstacle to practical data-based reduced order modeling, which is the difficulty in generating suitable data. I will attempt to describe all the steps without assuming any previous familiarity with this subject matter. 
* 3:45 Reception (light refreshments)
* 4:15 Mimi Koehl, UC Berkeley: Hairy little legs and noses: transitions in functions of appendages at low Reynolds number
* 5:15 Alex Mogilner, New York University: Intracellular fluid mechanics in cell motility and polarization
