# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare Research and Clinical Mixer

UC Davis Health and the ML/AI Working Groups are hosting a mixer for faculty researchers and clinicians interested in working at the interface of AI and healthcare. The goal of the mixer is to expand department, school and cross-causeway collaborations in the areas of artificial intelligence, automation
and robotics, and to faciliate proposal development in preparation for the [AI Research Funding Announcement](posts/News/2018AIHealthRFA.html) (due Nov. 15, 2018).
