### About MADDD

The MADDD seminar aims to gather researchers on all kinds of cutting-edge algorithmic and mathematical techniques used when analyzing and visualizing data, and then making optimal decisions. Thus talks and discussions on the seminar, most often directly motivated by applications, will include (but will not be limited to): Optimization, Applied Computational Harmonic Analysis,  Topological Data Analysis, Game Theory, Information theory, Theory of Machine Learning Algorithms, Computational Geometry,  Inverse problems, Shape optimization problems, Scheduling problems, Packing, Risk assessment models, Control theory, Computer vision problems, Statistical signal and image processing, Pattern Recognition problems, Clustering and classification, Data Compression, Discrete Mathematics, Numerical Linear and Tensor Algebra,  Random matrix theory, Convex and Functional analysis, etc. For more information see the [MADDD seminar webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/maddd/).
