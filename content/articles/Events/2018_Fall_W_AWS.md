[Register](https://forms.library.ucdavis.edu/classes/descriptions.php#class216)

This workshop will discuss the what, why and how of using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) to run your R, Pyton, etc. code for research in the cloud.

Specifically, the Enterprise Platforms team within IET will discuss Amazon Web Services, it's applications for data science and research and the resources IET is making available through its research computing environment.  We’ll discuss EC2 virtual machines, RDS for database instances, Lambda serverless code execution, AWS resources for running containers and discuss cost management and billing.  

We’ll also be introducing IET initiatives related to AWS provisioning and demonstrate the deployment of some basic AWS computing environments for data science research purposes. 

There will be resources available to answer specific questions about AWS and cloud services in general. 

Come join the discussion!
