# Data West Forum on Data Discovery and Industry Application

December 5-6, 2018 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine in La Jolla, CA.

Data West is a unique business and research exchange focused on knowledge discovery through data. We cover a wide range of topics and industry applications, from new ventures in science-based industries, “big data” data analytics, machine learning and AI at scale, to smart manufacturing and new technology adoption including blockchain, social robotics, cyber-physical systems and quantum computing. The conference runs in multiple formats, including a dedicated Industry Day and Tech Exhibitor Hall, and a concluding day Senior Executive Forum.
 
This year Data West is partnering with UCSD’s Center for Engineered Natural Intelligence (CENI), on Tuesday Dec 4, 2018.  CENI and Data West are offering a joint conference registration for all those interested in participating in both events.  The theme for CENI’s first annual research and industry symposium is “Tomorrow’s AI Today”.
